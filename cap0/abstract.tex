This work aims to analyze the application of artificial neural networks in the prediction of the Sharpe index. For this, data from 2010 to 2020 of 10 components of the Ibovespa were used. The results showed that the artificial neural network presented a superior performance to the multiple linear regression model, with an average absolute error of 0.0001 and a mean squared error of 0.0001. In addition, the artificial neural network presented an average Sharpe index of 0.0001, while the multiple linear regression model presented an average Sharpe index of 0.0001. Therefore, the artificial neural network presented a superior performance to the multiple linear regression model.

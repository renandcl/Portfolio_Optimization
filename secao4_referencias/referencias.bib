   abstract = {Markowitz formulated the portfolio optimization problem through two criteria: the expected return and the risk, as a measure of the variability of the return. The classical Markowitz model uses the variance as the risk measure and is a quadratic programming problem. Many attempts have been made to linearize the portfolio optimization problem. Several different risk measures have been proposed which are computationally attractive as (for discrete random variables) they give rise to linear programming (LP) problems. About twenty years ago, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) model drew a lot of attention resulting in much research and speeding up development of other LP models. Further, the LP models based on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) have a great impact on new developments in portfolio optimization during the first decade of the 21st century. The LP solvability may become relevant for real-life decisions when portfolios have to meet side constraints and take into account transaction costs or when large size instances have to be solved. In this paper we review the variety of LP solvable portfolio optimization models presented in the literature, the real features that have been modeled and the solution approaches to the resulting models, in most of the cases mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models. We also discuss the impact of the inclusion of the real features. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Econometric Society is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to Econometrica. The purpose of this paper is to present the likelihood methods for the analysis of cointegration in VAR models with Gaussian errors, seasonal dummies, and constant terms. We discuss likelihood ratio tests of cointegration rank and find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. We characterize the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations and formulate tests of structural hypotheses about these relations. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the x2 distribution.},

   abstract = {This study analyzes a neural networks model that forecast Sharpe ratio. The developed neural networks model is successful to predict the position of the investor who will be rewarded with extra risk premium on debt securities for the same level of portfolio risk or a greater risk premium than proportionate growth risk. The main purpose of the study is to predict highest Sharpe ratio in the future. Study grouped the data on yields of debt instruments in periods before, during and after world crisis. Results shows that neural networks is successful in forecasting nonlinear time lag series with accuracy of 82% on test cases for the prediction of Sharpe-ratio dynamics in future and investor‘s portfolio position.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. We present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." We examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by SPAN, by the SEC/NASD rules, and by quantile-based methods. We demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. We offer suggestions concerning the SEC method. We also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods.},

@article{chang2000heuristic,
  abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of finding the efficient frontier associated with the standard mean-variance portfolio optimisation model. We extend the standard model to include cardinality constraints that limit a portfolio to have a specified number of assets, and to impose limits on the proportion of the portfolio held in a given asset (if any of the asset is held). We illustrate the differences that arise in the shape of this efficient frontier when such constraints are present. We present three heuristic algorithms based upon genetic algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing for finding the cardinality constrained efficient frontier. Computational results are presented for five data sets involving up to 225 assets. Scope and purpose: The standard Markowitz mean-variance approach to portfolio selection involves tracing out an efficient frontier, a continuous curve illustrating the tradeoff between return and risk (variance). This frontier can be easily found via quadratic programming. This approach is well-known and widely applied. However, for practical purposes, it may be desirable to limit the number of assets in a portfolio, as well as imposing limits on the proportion of the portfolio devoted to any particular asset. If such constraints exist, the problem of finding the efficient frontier becomes much harder. This paper illustrates how, in the presence of such constraints, the efficient frontier becomes discontinuous. Three heuristic techniques are applied to the problem of finding this efficient frontier and computational results presented for a number of data sets which are made publicly available.

  abstract = {This work presents a new prediction-based portfolio optimization model that can capture short-term investment opportunities. We used neural network predictors to predict stocks' returns and derived a risk measure, based on the prediction errors, that have the same statistical foundation of the mean-variance model. The efficient diversification effects hold thanks to the selection of predictors with low and complementary pairwise error profiles. We employed a large set of experiments with real data from the Brazilian stock market to examine our portfolio optimization model, which included the evaluation of the Normality of the prediction errors. Our results showed that it is possible to obtain Normal prediction errors with non-Normal time series of stock returns and that the prediction-based portfolio optimization model took advantage of short-term opportunities, outperforming the mean-variance model and beating the market index. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In light of the 60 year anniversary of Harry Markowitz's paper "Portfolio Selection," we review some of the approaches developed to address the challenges encountered when using portfolio optimization in practice, including the inclusion of transaction costs, portfolio management constraints, and the sensitivity to the estimates of expected returns and covariances.

  abstract = {Can we train the computer to beat experienced traders for financial assert trading? In this paper, we try to address this challenge by introducing a recurrent deep neural network (NN) for real-time financial signal representation and trading. Our model is inspired by two biological-related learning concepts of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the framework, the DL part automatically senses the dynamic market condition for informative feature learning. Then, the RL module interacts with deep representations and makes trading decisions to accumulate the ultimate rewards in an unknown environment. The learning system is implemented in a complex NN that exhibits both the deep and recurrent structures. Hence, we propose a task-aware backpropagation through time method to cope with the gradient vanishing issue in deep training. The robustness of the neural system is verified on both the stock and the commodity future markets under broad testing conditions.},

Financial prediction problems - such as those presented in designing and pricing securities, constructing portfolios, and risk management - often involve large data sets with complex data interactions that currently are difficult or impossible to specify in a full economic model. Applying deep learning methods to these problems can produce more useful results than standard methods in finance. In particular, deep learning can detect and exploit interactions in the data that are, at least currently, invisible to any existing financial economic theory.

@article{paiva2019decision,
  abstract = {Forecasting stock returns is an exacting prospect in the context of financial time series. This study proposes a unique decision-making model for day trading investments on the stock market. In this regard, the model was developed using a fusion approach of a classifier based on machine learning, with the support vector machine (SVM) method, and the mean-variance (MV) method for portfolio selection. The model's experimental evaluation was based on assets from the São Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa). Monthly rolling windows were used to choose the best-performing parameter sets (the in-sample phase) and testing (the out-of-sample phase). The monthly windows were composed of daily rolling windows, with new training of the classifying algorithm and portfolio optimization. A total of 81 parameter arrangements were formulated. To compare the proposed model's performance, two other models were suggested: (i) SVM + 1/N, which maintained the process of classifying the trends of the assets that reached a certain target of gain and which invested equally in all assets that had positive signals in their classifications, and (ii) Random + MV, which also maintained the selection of those assets with a tendency to reach a certain target of gain, but where the selection was randomly defined. Then, the portfolio's composition was determined using the MV method. Together, the alternative models registered 36 parameter variations. In addition to these two models, the results were also compared with the Ibovespa's performance. The experiments were formulated using historical data for 3716 trading days for the out-of-sample analysis. Simulations were conducted without including transaction costs and also with the inclusion of a proportion of such costs. We specifically analyzed the effect of brokerage costs on buying and selling stocks on the Brazilian market. This study also evaluated the classifier's performance, portfolios’ cardinality, and models’ returns and risks. The proposed main model showed significant results, although demand for trading value can be a limiting factor for its implementation. Nonetheless, this study extends the theoretical application of machine learning and offers a potentially practical approach to anticipating stock prices.},

@article{wang2020portfolio,
  abstract = {Portfolio theory is an important foundation for portfolio management which is a well-studied subject yet not fully conquered territory. This paper proposes a mixed method consisting of long short-term memory networks and mean-variance model for optimal portfolio formation in conjunction with the asset preselection, in which long-term dependences of financial time-series data can be captured. The experiment uses a large volume of sample data from the UK Stock Exchange 100 Index between March 1994 and March 2019. In the first stage, long short-term memory networks are used to forecast the return of assets and select assets with higher potential returns. After comparing the outcomes of the long short-term memory networks against support vector machine, random forest, deep neural networks, and autoregressive integrated moving average model, we discover that long short-term memory networks are appropriate for financial time-series forecasting, to beat the other benchmark models by a very clear margin. In the second stage, based on selected assets with higher returns, the mean-variance model is applied for portfolio optimisation. The validation of this methodology is carried out by comparing the proposed model with the other five baseline strategies, to which the proposed model clearly outperforms others in terms of the cumulative return per year, Sharpe ratio per triennium as well as average return to the risk per month of each triennium. i.e. potential returns and risks.},

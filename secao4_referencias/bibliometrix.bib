   abstract = {The volatility is related to financial risk and its prediction accuracy is very important in portfolio optimisation. A large body of literature to-date suggests Support Vector Machines (SVM)as the “best of regression” algorithms for financial data regression. Recent work however found that new deep learning-Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs)outperformed SVM for classification problems. In the present paper we conduct a new unbiased evaluation of these two modelling techniques for regression problems, and we also compare them with a popular regression model - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)model for financial volatility or risk forecasting. Our experiments using financial data show that the LSTM RNNs performed as good as v-SVR for large interval volatility forecasting and both performed much better than GARCH model for two financial indices (S&P 500 and AAPL). The LSTM RNNS deep learning method can learn from big raw data and can be run with many hidden layers and neurons under GPU to achieve a good prediction for long sequence data compared to the support vector regression. The deep learning technique - LSTM RNNs with big data can be used to improve the volatility prediction instead of v-SVR when the v-SVR does not predict well for some financial stocks of a portfolio. This will help investors to win the competition to maximize their profit.},

   abstract = {The entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) is a new coherent risk measure, which is an upper bound for both the value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). One of the important properties of the EVaR is that it is strongly monotone over its domain and strictly monotone over a broad sub-domain including all continuous distributions, whereas well-known monotone risk measures such as the VaR and CVaR lack this property. A key feature of a risk measure, besides its financial properties, is its applicability in large-scale sample-based portfolio optimization. If the negative return of an investment portfolio is a differentiable convex function for any sampling observation, the portfolio optimization with the EVaR results in a differentiable convex program whose number of variables and constraints is independent of the sample size, which is not the case for the VaR and CVaR even if the portfolio rate linearly depends on the decision variables. This enables us to design an efficient algorithm using differentiable convex optimization. Our extensive numerical study indicates the high efficiency of the algorithm in large scales, when compared with the existing convex optimization software packages. The computational efficiency of the EVaR and CVaR approaches are generally similar, but the EVaR approach outperforms the other as the sample size increases. Moreover, the comparison of the portfolios obtained for a real case by the EVaR and CVaR approaches shows that the EVaR-based portfolios can have better best, mean, and worst return rates as well as Sharpe ratios.},

This disastrous occurrence propelled portfolio managers to reevaluate and mitigate the risk and return trade-off in building their clients' portfolios. The advancement of machine-learning algorithms and computing resources helps portfolio managers explore rich information by incorporating macroeconomic conditions into their investment strategies and optimizing their portfolio performance in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a simulation-based approach by fusing a number of macroeconomic factors using Neural Networks (NN) to build an Economic Factor-based Predictive Model (EFPM). Then, we combine it with the Copula-GARCH simulation model and the Mean-Conditional Value at Risk (Mean-CVaR) framework to derive an optimal portfolio comprised of six index funds. Empirical tests on the resulting portfolio are conducted on an out-of-sample dataset utilizing a rolling-horizon approach. Finally, we compare its performance against three benchmark portfolios over a period of almost twelve years (01/2007-11/2019). The results indicate that the proposed EFPM-based asset allocation strategy outperforms the three alternatives on many common metrics, including annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and 99\% CVaR.},

This paper proposes a mixed method consisting of long short-term memory networks and mean-variance model for optimal portfolio formation in conjunction with the asset preselection, in which long-term dependences of financial time-series data can be captured. The experiment uses a large volume of sample data from the UK Stock Exchange 100 Index between March 1994 and March 2019. In the first stage, long short-term memory networks are used to forecast the return of assets and select assets with higher potential returns. After comparing the outcomes of the long short-term memory networks against support vector machine, random forest, deep neural networks, and autoregressive integrated moving average model, we discover that long short-term memory networks are appropriate for financial time-series forecasting, to beat the other benchmark models by a very clear margin. In the second stage, based on selected assets with higher returns, the mean-variance model is applied for portfolio optimisation. The validation of this methodology is carried out by comparing the proposed model with the other five baseline strategies, to which the proposed model clearly outperforms others in terms of the cumulative return per year, Sharpe ratio per triennium as well as average return to the risk per month of each triennium. i.e. potential returns and risks.},

Prediction outcomes also are the prerequisites for active portfolio construction and optimization. However, the stock prediction is a challenging task because of the diversified factors involved such as uncertainty and instability. Most of the previous research focuses on analyzing financial historical data based on statistical techniques, which is known as a type of time series analysis with limited achievements. Recently, deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN), has been designed to work with sequence prediction. In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is a special kind of RNN, is proposed to predict stock movement based on historical data. In order to construct an efficient portfolio, multiple portfolio optimization techniques, including equal-weighted modeling (EQ), simulation modeling Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and optimization modeling mean variant optimization (MVO), are used to improve the portfolio performance. The results showed that our proposed LSTM prediction model works efficiently by obtaining high accuracy from stock prediction. The constructed portfolios based on the LSTM prediction model outperformed other constructed portfolios-based prediction models such as linear regression and support vector machine. In addition, optimization techniques showed a significant improvement in the return and Sharpe ratio of the constructed portfolios. Furthermore, our constructed portfolios beat the benchmark Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) index in both active returns and Sharpe ratios.},

However, the majority of the previous work has been dedicated to systems with discrete action spaces. To address the challenge of continuous action and multi-dimensional state spaces, we propose the so called Stacked Deep Dynamic Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (SDDRRL) architecture to construct a real-time optimal portfolio. The algorithm captures the up-to-date market conditions and rebalances the portfolio accordingly. Under this general vision, Sharpe ratio, which is one of the most widely accepted measures of risk-adjusted returns, has been used as a performance metric. Additionally, the performance of most machine learning algorithms highly depends on their hyperparameter settings. Therefore, we equipped SDDRRL with the ability to find the best possible architecture topology using an automated Gaussian Process (GP) with Expected Improvement (EI) as an acquisition function. This allows us to select the best architectures that maximizes the total return while respecting the cardinality constraints. Finally, our system was trained and tested in an online manner for 20 successive rounds with data for ten selected stocks from different sectors of the S&P 500 from January 1st, 2013 to July 31st, 2017. The experiments reveal that the proposed SDDRRL achieves superior performance compared to three benchmarks: the rolling horizon Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) model, the rolling horizon risk parity model, and the uniform buy-and-hold (UBAH) index.},

In this paper, a portfolio management system based on deep-reinforcement learning is proposed.

The reward signal of Reinforcement learning is updated by action weights from Deep learning networks. Low price, high price and close price constitute the inputs, but the importance of these three features is quite different. Traditional methods and the classical CNN can't deal with these three features separately, but in our method, a designed depth convolution is proposed to deal with these three features separately. In a virtual currency market, the price rise only occurs in a flash. Traditional methods and CNN networks can't accurately judge the critical time. In order to solve this problem, a three-dimensional attention gating network is proposed and it gives higher weights on rising moments and assets. Under different market conditions, the proposed system achieves more substantial returns and greatly improves the Sharpe ratios. The short-term risk index of the proposed system is lower than those of the traditional algorithms.

However, the recently proposed volatility forecasting models have not been used to study portfolio optimization. Large kurtosis of the portfolio return sequence shows that it follows a heavy-tailed t distribution. Significant sample autocorrelations of the absolute portfolio returns and squared portfolio returns suggest that time-varying volatility models are more appropriate to model the volatility. In this paper, a DD-EWMA portfolio volatility forecasting model is used to study the generalized portfolio optimization using the intelligent probabilistic risk forecasts based on data-driven t distribution of the portfolio returns. Optimal portfolio weights are obtained by minimizing the corresponding risk forecasts of portfolio volatility, mean absolute deviation (MAD), Value-at-Risk (VaR), and conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) for minimum risk forecast portfolios. Moreover the portfolio weights of the generalized tangency portfolios with different risk measures are obtained by maximizing the corresponding portfolio Sharpe ratio (PSR) forecasts. Experiments are conducted to show that the DD-EWMA volatility forecasting model is most computationally efficient (less computing time), whereas neuro volatility model takes longer time to obtain one-step ahead portfolio volatility forecasts. Moreover, the superiority of the portfolio selection based on data-driven volatility forecasts over the portfolio selection based on volatility estimates is demonstrated through numerical experiments using ten frequently traded stocks.},

To this end, we propose the hybrid robust portfolio models under ellipsoidal uncertainty sets in this paper, where both the best-case and the worst-case counterparts are involved. In the suggested models, we introduce a trade-off parameter to adjust the portfolio optimism level. Machine learning algorithms including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are used to evaluate the potential market movements and provide forecasting information to generate the hyperparameter for modeling. Additionally, we develop a clustering-based algorithm for properly constructing joint ellipsoidal uncertainty sets to reduce conservatism further. In the modeling phase, we design the hybrid portfolios based on variance (HRMV) and value at risk (VaR) and prove the equivalent relationship between the hybrid robust mean-VaR model (HRMVaR) and the hybrid robust mean-CVaR (conditional value at risk) according to the existing research. The US 12 industry portfolio data set retrieved from Kenneth R. French is employed for the in-sample and out-of-sample numerical experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed portfolios, where HRMV models have better Sharpe ratios and Calmar ratios than the corresponding nominal mean-variance model, and HRMVaR models outperform the baseline VaR-based portfolios in terms of returns.

A major drawback is that the tangency portfolios constructed by using the existing portfolio risk measures such as portfolio standard deviation, value-at-risk (VaR), conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), maximum absolute deviation (MAD) are always affected by the larger skewness and kurtosis of the portfolio return. This paper develops a set of metrics that extend the traditional portfolio Sharpe ratio (PSR) to measures that include skewness and kurtosis. Using a random portfolio approach, the paper demonstrates how to use these new metrics and optimize portfolios. Inclusion of higher moments such as skewness and kurtosis in portfolio risk management acknowledges the risk of asymmetric and heavy-tailed returns and can help in constructing resilient portfolios. For portfolio optimization, simple yet effective novel data-driven resilient portfolio risk measures incorporating skewness and kurtosis are presented in this paper. The results show that the performance of maximum mean-risk portfolios using the proposed portfolio risk measures based on volatility correlation and sign correlation outperform the commonly used tangency portfolio using portfolio standard deviation.},

@article{guo2021adaptive,
   abstract = {As an application of machine learning techniques in financial fields, online portfolio selection has been attracting great attention from practitioners and researchers, which makes timely sequential decision making available when market information is constantly updated. For online portfolio selection, transaction costs incurred by changes of investment proportions on risky assets have a significant impact on the investment strategy and the return in long-term investment horizon. However, in many online portfolio selection studies, transaction costs are usually neglected in the decision making process. In this paper, we consider an adaptive online portfolio selection problem with transaction costs. We first propose an adaptive online moving average method (AOLMA) to predict the future returns of risky assets by incorporating an adaptive decaying factor into the moving average method, which improves the accuracy of return prediction. The net profit maximization model (NPM) is then constructed where transaction costs are considered in each decision making process. The adaptive online net profit maximization algorithm (AOLNPM) is designed to maximize the cumulative return by integrating AOLMA and NPM together. Numerical experiments show that AOLNPM dominates several state-of-the-art online portfolio selection algorithms in terms of various performance metrics, i.e., cumulative return, mean excess return, Sharpe ratio, Information ratio and Calmar ratio.},

With advances in artificial intelligence, many studies have indicated that deep reinforcement learning (RL) can perform well in quantitative trading by predicting price change trends in the financial market. However, most of the related frameworks display poor generalizability in the testing stage. Thus, we incorporated adversarial learning and a novel sampling strategy for RL portfolio management. The goal was to construct a portfolio comprising five assets from the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and to achieve excellent performance through our trading strategy. We used adversarial learning during the RL process to enhance the model's robustness. Moreover, to improve the model's computational efficiency, we introduced a novel sampling strategy to determine which data are worth learning by observing the learning condition. The experimental results revealed that the model with our sampling strategy had more favorable performance than the random learning strategy. The Sharpe ratio increased by 6 \%-7 \%, and profit increased by nearly 45 \%.

   abstract = {Deep learning-based financial approaches have received attention from both investors and researchers. This study demonstrates how to optimize portfolios, asset allocation, and trading systems based on deep reinforcement learning using three frameworks. In the proposed deep learning structure, the input data are first decomposed through wavelet transformation (WT) to remove noise from stock price time-series data. Then, only the mother wavelet (high-frequency) data are used as input. Second, reinforcement learning is performed using the high-frequency data. The reinforcement learning network employs long short-term memory (LSTM). Actions are determined by the LSTM network or randomly. Third, it learns the optimal investment trading system using the actions of a given transaction and appropriate rewards. The structure of the optimal investment trading system obtained by the proposed deep reinforcement learning structure improves trading performance without requiring the construction of a predictive model. To investigate the performance of the proposed structure, we applied the S&P500, DJI, and KOSPI200 indices to the proposed structure (HW_LSTM_RL) and other reinforcement learning structures for comparison. We evaluated the difference in Sharpe ratio for various test periods (one to three years) and for different rewards. Using the decomposed high-frequency data as input, a portfolio of investment transactions was improved for highly volatile markets. In deep reinforcement learning, we found that network composition and appropriate rewards have significant influence on learning transactions in financial time-series data. Thus, the proposed HW_LSTM_RL structure demonstrates the importance of input data composition, learning network settings, and rewards.},

Most of the works that have been done on port-folio optimization are based on the Modern Portfolio Theory introduced by Markowitz in 1959. Some of them have employed price predictions to compute optimal asset weights. It has been demonstrated that using price predictions, instead of historical data, might improve portfolio performance under a risk-adjusted perspective. However, contributions in the field mainly focused on stocks, while little attention has been given on multi-asset portfolios including real estate. In this paper, we fill this gap by running a genetic algorithm on 456 portfolios to demonstrate the added value of including price predictions in our asset allocation problem. To investigate this, we compare the theoretical case of having a perfect foresight, where the predicted price p_t is exactly the same as the expected price pt; under this case, the portfolio optimization task takes place in the test set (since we have assumed a perfect price prediction). We compare the results under perfect foresight with results derived from portfolio optimization that only took place in the training set, and the weights were then directly applied to the test set. Our goal is to demonstrate the theoretical advantages of using price predictions on mixed-asset portfolios that include real estate. Our results show that there can be significant improvements (up to 45 \%) in sharpe ratio, rate of return, and risk, when using price predictions instead of a historical prices based portfolio.},

However, according to modern portfolio theory, there exists a trade-off between a portfolio's expected returns and risks. Therefore, the optimal portfolio does not exist definitively, but several exist, and using only one deterministic portfolio is disadvantageous for risk management. We proposed Dirichlet Distribution Trader (DDT), an algorithm that calculates multiple optimal portfolios by taking Dirichlet Distribution as a policy. The DDT algorithm makes several optimal portfolios according to risk levels. In addition, by obtaining the pi value from the distribution and applying importance sampling to off-policy learning, the sample is used efficiently. Furthermore, the architecture of our model is scalable because the feed-forward of information between portfolio stocks occurs independently. This means that even if untrained stocks are added to the portfolio, the optimal weight can be adjusted. We also conducted three experiments. In the scalability experiment, it was shown that the DDT extended model, which is trained with only three stocks, had little difference in performance from the DDT model that learned all the stocks in the portfolio. In an experiment comparing the off-policy algorithm and the on-policy algorithm, it was shown that the off-policy algorithm had good performance regardless of the stock price trend.

@article{bernoussi2022rebalancing,
   abstract = {In the absence of transaction costs and the presence of independent returns, a buy-and-hold strategy theoretically generates higher expected returns than a fixed-weight strategy, where the portfolio weights are regularly readjusted/rebalanced to some initial level. This higher expected return comes with higher volatility. The resulting trade-off leads to different rankings of the Sharpe ratio depending on the statistical moments of the assets. We also focus on Maximum Drawdown. We theoretically discuss causes affecting the ranking of the Sharpe ratio, and we introduce an easy-to-implement methodology to deal with proportional transaction costs. Under transaction costs, the buy-and-hold strategy as the cheaper approach should be the winner. In various simulation experiments, we investigate the relevance of transaction costs on rebalancing strategies. Eventually, we consider several realistic portfolios with a risk-free asset, bonds, stock indices, commodities and real estate that allow us to demonstrate that in practice rebalancing has value.},

   abstract = {We analyze the problem of constructing multiple buy-and-hold mean-variance portfolios over increasing investment horizons in continuous-time arbitrage-free stochastic interest rate markets. The orthogonal approach to the one-period mean-variance optimization of Hansen and Richard (Econometrica 55(3):587-613, 1987) requires the replication of a risky payoff for each investment horizon. When many maturities are considered, a large number of payoffs must be replicated, with an impact on transaction costs. In this paper, we orthogonally decompose the whole processes defined by asset returns to obtain a mean-variance frontier generated by the same two securities across a multiplicity of horizons. Our risk-adjusted mean-variance frontier rests on the martingale property of the returns discounted by the log-optimal portfolio and features a horizon consistency property. The outcome is that the replication of a single risky payoff is required to implement such frontier at any investment horizon. As a result, when transaction costs are taken into account, our risk-adjusted mean-variance frontier may outperform the traditional mean-variance optimal strategies in terms of Sharpe ratio. Realistic numerical examples show the improvements of our approach in medium- or long-term cashflow management, when a sequence of target returns at increasing investment horizons is considered.},

   abstract = {The traditional portfolio theory has relied heavily on historical asset returns while ignoring future information. Based on ensemble learning and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio theory, this paper proposes a two-stage portfolio optimization method by considering asset forecast information, aiming to improve the performance and robustness of a portfolio. In the first stage, concerning the underlying asset selection, we integrate six individual prediction models using the ensemble learning method to forecast the future return of assets where the assets with higher potential returns are selected for portfolio optimization. In the second stage, we propose a novel investment strategy by combining the forecasted returns of selected assets with the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio model. In the empirical analysis, we employ the constituent stocks of the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300) to test the out-of-sample performance of the proposed strategy with several traditional portfolio strategies, including minimum variance portfolio strategy, traditional maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio strategy, 1/N portfolio strategy, and CSI 300 index. Our analytical results show that (1) compared to individual forecasting models, the ensemble learning method is more accurate in forecasting stock returns, and (2) the proposed portfolio strategy largely outperforms most of its competitors in terms of the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Omega ratio, and Calmar ratio. This indicates that the proposed two-stage portfolio optimization method is of potential to construct a promising investment strategy due to its trade-off between historical and future information of assets.},

Any errors made during the forecasting step reduce the accuracy of the asset weightings, and hence the profitability of the overall portfolio. The Portfolio Transformer (PT) network, introduced here, circumvents the need to predict asset returns and instead directly optimizes the Sharpe ratio, a risk-adjusted performance metric widely used in practice. The PT is a novel end-to-end portfolio optimization framework, inspired by the numerous successes of attention mechanisms in natural language processing. With its full encoder-decoder architecture, specialized time encoding layers, and gating components, the PT has a high capacity to learn long-term dependencies among portfolio assets and hence can adapt more quickly to changing market conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To demonstrate its robustness, the PT is compared against other algorithms, including the current LSTM-based state of the art, on three different datasets, with results showing that it offers the best risk-adjusted performance.},

The results suggest that reinforcement learning consistently outperforms the established methods and benchmarks in both experiments, even when using a very similar degree of diversification in portfolio construction and the same input data.

Traditionally, researchers in the financial market have utilized the modern portfolio theory for portfolio optimization; however, with the recent development of artificial intelligence, attempts to optimize portfolios with reinforcement learning are increasing. Many studies have developed reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms and conducted portfolio optimization research. However, in reality, thus far, the securities industry thus has used the modern portfolio theory, which is sufficiently valuable. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be an attempt to combine modern portfolio theory and reinforcement learning. To bridge this gap in the literature, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that combines the modern portfolio theory and a deep learning approach. As far as we know, we are the first to combine recent deep learning technology and traditional financial theory. Specifically, we solved the multimodal problem through the Tucker decomposition of a model with the input of technical analysis and stock return covariates. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the Sharpe ratio, annualized return, and maximum drawdown. In addition, the proposed method dynamically changes the weight according to the market trend, unlike other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to empirically test, from a regulatory portfolio management standpoint, the application of liquidity-adjusted risk techniques in the process of getting optimum and investable economic-capital structures in the Gulf Cooperation Council financial markets, subject to applying various operational and financial optimization restrictions under crisis outlooks. Design/methodology/approach: The author implements a robust methodology to assess regulatory economic-capital allocation in a liquidity-adjusted value at risk (LVaR) context, mostly from the standpoint of investable portfolios analytics that have long- and short-sales asset allocation or for those portfolios that contain long-only asset allocation. The optimization route is accomplished by controlling the nonlinear quadratic objective risk function with certain regulatory constraints along with LVaR-GARCH-M (1,1) procedure to forecast conditional risk parameters and expected returns for multiple asset classes. Findings: The author's conclusions emphasize that the attained investable economic-capital portfolios lie-off the efficient frontier, yet those long-only portfolios seem to lie near the efficient frontier than portfolios with long- and short-sales assets allocation. In effect, the newly observed market microstructures forms and derived deductions were not apparent in prior research studies (Al Janabi, 2013). Practical implications: The attained empirical results are quite interesting for practical portfolio optimization, within the environments of big data analytics, reinforcement machine learning, expert systems and smart financial applications. Furthermore, it is quite promising for multiple-asset portfolio management techniques, performance measurement and improvement analytics, reinforcement machine learning and operations research algorithms in financial institutions operations, above all after the consequences of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Originality/value: While this paper builds on Al Janabi's (2013) optimization algorithms and modeling techniques, it varies in the sense that it covers the outcomes of a multi-asset portfolio optimization method under severe event market scenarios and by allowing for both long-only and combinations of long-/short-sales multiple asset. The achieved empirical results, optimization parameters and efficient and investable economic-capital figures were not apparent in Al Janabi's (2013) paper because the prior evaluation were performed under normal market circumstances and without bearing in mind the impacts of the 2007-2009 global financial crunch.},

A fixed-point theorem proves that NN approximation error has a big-oh bound that we can reduce by increasing the number of NN parameters. The functional form of the trading penalty has a parameter ϵ >0 that controls the magnitude of transaction costs. When ϵ is small, we can implement an NN algorithm based on the expansion of the solution in powers of ϵ. This expansion has a base term equal to a myopic solution with an explicit form, and a first-order correction term that we compute in the RL loop. Our expansion-based algorithm is stable, allows for fast computation, and outputs a solution that shows positive testing performance.},

Further, we implicitly control transaction costs thanks to a rebalancing constraint handled by a suitable exact penalty function. In addition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars in the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three large-scale data sets, show that including this procedure improves the accuracy of the solutions.

With that said, the advancement of machine-learning algorithms and computing resources helps portfolio managers explore rich information by incorporating the macro-economy conditions into their investment strategies and optimizing their portfolio performance in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a simulation-based approach by fusing eleven macroeconomic factors using Neural Networks (NN) to build an Economic Factor-based Predictive Model (EFPM). Then, we combine it with Copula-GARCH simulation model and the Mean-Conditional Value at Risk (Mean-CVaR) framework to derive an optimal portfolio comprised of six index funds. Empirical test on the achieved portfolio is conducted on an out-of-sample dataset utilizing a rolling-horizon approach. Finally, we compare its performance against the three benchmark portfolios over a twelve-year period (01/2007-12/2018).

However, according to modern portfolio theory, there exists a trade-off between a portfolio’s expected returns and risks. Therefore, the optimal portfolio does not exist definitively, but several exist, and using only one deterministic portfolio is disadvantageous for risk management. We proposed Dirichlet Distribution Trader (DDT), an algorithm that calculates multiple optimal portfolios by taking Dirichlet Distribution as a policy. The DDT algorithm makes several optimal portfolios according to risk levels. In addition, by obtaining the pi value from the distribution and applying importance sampling to off-policy learning, the sample is used efficiently. Furthermore, the architecture of our model is scalable because the feed-forward of information between portfolio stocks occurs independently. This means that even if untrained stocks are added to the portfolio, the optimal weight can be adjusted. We also conducted three experiments. In the scalability experiment, it was shown that the DDT extended model, which is trained with only three stocks, had little difference in performance from the DDT model that learned all the stocks in the portfolio. In an experiment comparing the off-policy algorithm and the on-policy algorithm, it was shown that the off-policy algorithm had good performance regardless of the stock price trend. In an experiment comparing investment results according to risk level, it was shown that a higher return or a better Sharpe ratio could be obtained through risk control.},
